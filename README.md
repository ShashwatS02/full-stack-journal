## HTML Fundamentals Project
This repository encapsulates an elementary yet structurally sound exploration of HTML semantics and web document construction. It includes:

- Usage of `<head>` metadata and viewport settings for responsive design
- Practice with structural elements like headings, paragraphs, and anchor tags
- Demonstration of both ordered and unordered lists for hierarchical data representation
- Basic interlinking between HTML files and integration of external assets
- Sample text files to simulate linked resources or placeholder content

The intention behind this project is to solidify foundational web development principles with clean, readable markup adhering to W3C standards.
